        I am a developer and an open-source enthusiast.
        <br />
        I am primarily a web front-end developer, with a tech stack mainly focused on Vue. Of course, I also enjoy working with React. I am particularly fascinated by TypeScript, although I am still learning and practicing it. When it comes to code, I prefer explicit and controllable approaches, and dislike implicit and uncontrollable ones. I enjoy experimenting with new things and sharing my findings.
